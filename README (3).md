## 📌 Project Title
**Method Design & Modular Calculator**

## 📘 Internship Task
**JAVA DEVELOPER INTERNSHIP – TASK 4**

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a **console-based modular calculator application** developed in **Java**.  
Each arithmetic operation is implemented using **separate methods** to demonstrate
proper **method design, modularity, and reusability**.

The project also showcases important Java concepts such as:
- Method Overloading
- Pass-by-Value behavior
- Exception Handling
- Utility methods
- Clean and structured code

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a calculator using **modular methods**
- Demonstrate **method overloading**
- Handle **divide-by-zero exceptions**
- Show **pass-by-value** in Java
- Improve code readability and reduce redundancy

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  
- **JDK Version:** JDK 8 or above  

---

## ⚙ Features Implemented
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Separate methods for each operation
- Method overloading using `int` and `double`
- Reusable utility method
- Exception handling for division by zero
- Pass-by-value demonstration
- Well-documented methods using JavaDoc
